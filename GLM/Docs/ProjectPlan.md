**Author**: Team 6 (Project Manager: Justin Cortez)

## 1. Introduction

To keep our daily routines ever more paperless in our environmentlally conscious world, use our *Grocery List Manager*. This is one stop application where you can create and edit a collection of grocery lists with an interactive check-off system to keep track of any item you already grabbed. Download today!

## 2. Process Description

**Software Design**\
*Activity description*: Once the instructions of the project were given and a final product was in mind, the group collaborated on a Class Diagram to specify the neccessary and extra requirements needed to create the product. We took nouns from the product description to create classes and adjectives to form tentative methods that every class should be able to complete. This will be used as a template to create a component diagram\
*Entrance criteria*: Instructions from stakeholders or consumer\
*Exit criteria*: Creation of Class diagram

**Inception and Elaboration**\
*Activity description*: This is where our team did our initial communication and planning about what the project was asking us and how we should goa bout starting it. We took a look at what directions that given about the concept of the design and mandatory requirements (such as Android Studio being the main software for creating the app) and planned out a design strategy. This was done to organize our process and have something to refer to in case we get stuck on what to do next. \
*Entrance criteria*: Understanding of the general task being ask of and what components are necessary for its function.\
*Exit criteria*: Creation of organized documents projecting the process plan, a use case model, design document describing the considerations that should be made about the project and the resources we will use to complete its creation, and a test plan which will layout how we go about debugging our work. 

**Construction**\
*Activity description*: Once our plan is laid out in concise markdown files, we now take what was documented and start creating the code for it. This is where the database is constructed, designs on attributes and their names are chosen in the UI, and those attributes are connected to the main code that serves the main functionalities. Throughout our time coding there might need to be some revision to previous documents in order to better suit the system more appropriately. Once most of the code is finished there should be some kind of functional Alpha/Beta version of the app that is able to complete most of the necessary tasks if not all so more attention can be focused on making the system more user friendly. Testing should also be done in this phase as well as the creation of a user manual to guide a user through the system's functions.\
*Entrance criteria*: Functional completion of the system that allows it to complete its most basic tasks.\
*Exit criteria*: Alpha/Beta version of the system, a user manual explaining how to navigate the system, and proper testing completed on the system. (these criteria may need to be completed multiple times and previous phases may need to be revised)

**Transition**\
*Activity description*: Before the application is set for its final release, most of the testing should be done in this phase. All main functionalities should be present and some development in the UI/UX should be worked on. Based on the Agile process we are following, revisions of previous phases are welcome and necessary to fix the original designs we created. We expect to change the original ideas of development after spending more time with the system and understanding the environments more.\
*Entrance criteria*: System in its final phases of development, that is open up to testing.\
*Exit criteria*: Completed system with all necessary and cosmetic designs implemented, still open for suture testing to improve the app once its live to stakeholders.

- *Roles*
	* **Project Manager:** Responsible for organizing the project's processes and distributing the workload between the team and themselves. Also ensures the return of all deliverables and checkpoints at the appropriate dates. Serves also as buffer for any questions that may need to be asked to the stakeholders to clarify the needs of the application and is able to flexibly work with any other team member on their portions of the project.
	* **Front-End Developer:** Responsible for taking the project designs and implementing them into code. Will connect the different classes and ensure their fuctionality. Will work with the UI designer to connect the correct methods to an interactive environment.
	* **Back-End Developer:** Responsible for designing and populating the database being used for relevent information that the application will pull from. Will also work with the Front-End Developer.
	* **Test Designer:** Responsible for identifying and defining the required tests to evaluate the overall quality experience and functions of the application. For early stages this position may not be utilized completely, so they will help in back end and front end development.
	*  **UI/UX Developer:** Responsible for creating the interface that a user will be able to naviagte through in order to use the application to its correct designations.
